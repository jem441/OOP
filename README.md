# Hello, Jimmy Martinez and Vanessa Herrera decided to group up after reading each others midterm summaries. We met up one day and worked on the project since we both live near campus. It was difficult to meet multiple times because of the pandemic, however, we hope you like our project. The package that we used for this project was the TextBlob package. We chose this because the features it has is very interesting since you can test whether a number is right or wrong. We decided on a number guessing game where the number was randomized each game and you only have one shot to guess it right, but the game will let you know how close you were to the answer. We had to install textBlob using 'pip install -U textblob' and 'python -m textblob.download_corpora' under a virtual environment we named textblobenv. In order to run the code properly, we had to activate and import TextBlob. Between lines 13 and 35, we focused on the else if statements for the game. The python code you want to run is the Final.py code.
