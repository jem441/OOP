# The package that I used for this project was the TextBlob package. I chose this because the polarity feature is very interesting since you can test whether a sentence is positive, negative, or neutral. I had to install it using 'pip install -U textblob' and 'python -m textblob.download_corpora' under a virtual environment I named textblobenv. In order to run the code properly, I had to import TextBlob. Between lines 9 and 15, I focused on the else if statement. Between lines 17 and 24, I displayed my understanding of functions and a simple doc string.If I were to use TextBlob for the final class project, I would definitely use it to check the polarity of the text as well as have a function where it translates the language. The python code you want to run is the midterm.py code I have posted on my feed.
